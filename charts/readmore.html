<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><i>I made a new pool on Tinyman, when will charts appear on FreeTinycharts?</i></p>
<p>FreeTinycharts grabs new pools every day. Wait 24-36 hours and if it doesn't appear search me in Telegram</p>
<p><i>Charts are updated every 15 minutes, it could be more often?</i></p>
<p>I doubt it at least in this stage.</p>
<p><i>Charts are not updated or price is old</i></p>
<p>Nope. Prices are shown in UTC time. I'll will work on this, to show it in your local timezone.</p>
<p><i>How FreeTinycharts work?</i></p>
<p>Prices are grabbed using fabulous <a href="https://github.com/tinymanorg/tinyman-py-sdk">Tinyman Python API</a></p>
<p><i>How much it cost to maintain the service?</i></p>
<p>While it doesn't track too much data and has no much traffic, it cost about 60eur/year. With donations I've already received (24/10/2021), I can maintain it for more than a year.</p>
<p><i>Where it will have a mobile user interface?</i></p>
<p>It's difficult to show usable charts in a small screen. I'll stick to this simple, fast design if nothing else better appears. If you think you can do it better, you can contribute.</p>
<p><i>Are new functionalities being added?</i></p>
<p>Yes! Donate or buy my ASA to show support for them and encourage me to continue. FreeTinycharts is yet under active development.</p>
<p><i>There will be an API or a show-chart-in-your-page?</i></p>
<p>Yes! I developed Wordpress plugins before so you can expect it in the near future. Also an easy to grab live price API.</p>
<p><i>There is no price data before 20/10/2021</i></p>
<p>Yes. Anyways, Tinyman started that month so less than 10 days of data are lost.</p>
<p><i>Will FreeTinycharts grab data from other sources?</i></p>
<p>Perhaps I can grab prices from Algodex when it go live. I'll show it in a dual-line graph.</p>
<p><i>I want to start my own charts service, could I get support from you?</i></p>
<p>Perhaps, for a small fee. Search me on Telegram!</p>
